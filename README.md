# puppeteer-event-popper
GitHub Action to use Puppeteer to publish event description to Eventpop

## How to use

1. Deploy an instance of ![event-popper](https://github.com/dtinth/event-popper) to Netlify.

   This gives you a REST API that you can use to deploy event descriptions to Eventpop,
   so that you donâ€™t need to put in your Eventpop credentials in your CD pipeline.

2. Create an HTML file. That file should declare a global JavaScript function called `getEventpopDescription()`
   which should return the HTML content to be deployed.
   It may optionally return a Promise, in which this script will await for the result.

   See [example/index.html](example/index.html) for a bare-bones example.

3. Go to your GitHub Repository settings &rarr; Secrets.
   Add the following secrets:

   - `EVENT_POPPER_API_KEY`
   - `EVENT_POPPER_URL`

4. Add the following workflow:

    ```yaml
    name: Deploy event description to Eventpop
    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - master
    jobs:
      build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v1
        - uses: docker://dtinth/puppeteer-event-popper:latest
          with:
            args: description.html
          env:
            EVENT_POPPER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.EVENT_POPPER_API_KEY }}
            EVENT_POPPER_URL: ${{ secrets.EVENT_POPPER_URL }}
    ```
